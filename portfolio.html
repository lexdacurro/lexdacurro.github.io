			<div class ='let-me-tell-you-about-my-portfolio'> 
			For me, I aim for simplicity and complexity. For an untrained eye, It would rather look simple, bland, if you may. 
			Yes, I do agree with that. However, What really sets my Portfolio from the other wonderful Portfolios out there is the uniqueness (or I love to think so).
			Also, In the, as we called it the "heart" of the page It is a complete wack-a-doodle.
			
			To generate all these pastel colors randomly, I deviced an Algorithm that will give Pastel Colors and will ignore the bright color that would give you eye strain such as <span style='color:#49fb35'> Neon Green </span>, etc...
			</div>
			<div class ='let-me-tell-you-about-my-portfolio'> 
			The concept behind this Algorithm is widely "experimented" and you can find it with simple Google Search. However, because of my inferior Googling skills, I wasn't able to find a suitable answer for my needs.
			So, I look for the term <u> Color Theory </u>.
			According to ever-reliable and not-so reliable source for academics, called the Wikipedia. <u> Color Theory </u> is basically a practical guidance to color mixing and visual effect on the color combination.
			</div>
			<div class ='let-me-tell-you-about-my-portfolio'> 
			Due to my unparallel determination, I was able to find a Programming blog (Sorry I couldn't remember the site's name) about Color Theory. He said about Generating Pastel color with a Mathematical Ratio called Golden Ratio &#934;.
			It is a number found by dividing a line into two sperate parts so that the longer part divided by those smaller parts is also equal to the original line.
			
			</div>
			<div class ='let-me-tell-you-about-my-portfolio'> 
			To be honest, I have no freaking idea how to use it. Yes, I am quite familiar with Golden Ratio because, during my high school up until my college years, I spend nights crying before I take Math Exam. An ignorant part of me didn't realize the potential use of this ratio.
			So, enough of the embarrassing story of my life. This is how I do it:

			</div>
			<div class ='let-me-tell-you-about-my-portfolio'> 
			So the concept is fairly simple-looking but really a complex one, First, I have to generate non-neon colors. In order to generate a random number, of course, you have to use a Native function such as <span style='opacity:.8'>Math.random() or rand() </span> 
			. However, this will not really guarantee to generate Pastel color only. It is just too convoluted. Too much randomness.
			So, when we generate a number like Even numbers. The values are very close to each other. <a style= 'color:blue;' href= "https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming-natural-simulations/programming-randomness/a/normal-distribution-of-random-numbers">[See this for more information...] </a>
			which is we try to elude because it will give you the same color at very highly probability.
			This is where the Golden Ratio came and saved me a like a damsel-in-distress. </div>
			<div class ='let-me-tell-you-about-my-portfolio'>  According to a book called, Data Structures and Algorithms with Object-Oriented Design Patterns in C++, the property of the golden ratio &#934;
			is that each ensuing value divides the interval into which it falls to the actual golden ratio. 
			the Distribution of the values are not really close to each other anymore! Thanks to the Golden Ratio!
		
			</div>
			<div class ='let-me-tell-you-about-my-portfolio'>
			This comes the easy part,the formula is simple. It just random value + the Golden Ratio &#934;. Oh, I almost forgot, It only generates HSL.
			Which can be easily converted to RGB. The good thing about my the front page grids is that it doesn't generate the same color per instance.
			The technique is fairly simple and straightforward. Compare the R,G,B values of all the grids then generate another R,G, or B to replace those with equal value.

				I know my Portfolio is simple looking, some of you may not like it, others may, I agree I know it's not that much but I'm 100% proud of it. All in all, my Portfolio is just the canvas for my wild imagination! Thank you for sparing your time visiting this nerd-fest portfolio! Have a good day! Passez une bonne journ√©e!
